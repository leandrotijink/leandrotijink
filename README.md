## Hi there ðŸ‘€

Glad to see you here! My name is LÃ©andro Tijink and I'm a Software Engineer, Designer, Founder, CEO and you could probably add Tinkerer to that as well. I very much enjoy playing around with various languages and tools to create something others may find useful and/or valuable.

Quite a few years ago I started a project to build a CMS, which was originally intended to power a few websites I worked on at the time. Many rewrites and fundamental changes to the architecture later, the project has transformed to be a product developed by Rovota. While it is still in its development stage, I can't wait to hear what people like you think of it. Make sure to keep an eye on [rovota.com](https://rovota.com), or join the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/vsfVXB4) ðŸ˜‰

## Activities

There's a few things I enjoy doing in order to get some balance. We can't be writing code 24/7... or can we? Apart from work, I tend to be active in various communities such as the [OnePlus Community on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/oneplus), as well as photography, tennis, drawing, games and watching movies that I vaguely remember from the past.

## Contact

While I can't guarantee a quick response, you can contact me via Twitter [@leandrotijink](https://twitter.com/leandrotijink). Be aware though, while my "DMs" are open for many things, advertising your services isn't one of them.
