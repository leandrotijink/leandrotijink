## Hi there ðŸ‘€

Glad to see you here! While I keep myself busy doing a lot of things, I'm still a software engineer and designer at heart. I very much enjoy playing around with various languages and tools to create something others may find useful and/or valuable.

## Activities

We can't be writing code 24/7... or can we? Apart from work, I tend to be active in various communities such as the [OnePlus Community on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/oneplus), as well as photography, drawing, playing games and watching movies that I vaguely remember from the past.

## Contact

While I can't guarantee a quick response, you can contact me via Twitter [@leandrotijink](https://twitter.com/leandrotijink). Be aware though, while my "DMs" are open for many things, advertising your services isn't one of them.
